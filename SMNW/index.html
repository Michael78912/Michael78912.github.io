            That's a picture of a test stage. I know some enemies are kind of
            underground; I intend on fixing that.

        Stickman's New World (often abbreviated SMNW) is a game based on
        <a href="https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/ranger">Stick Ranger</a>.
        Stick Ranger is a fantastic game, with the description of:
        "Action RPG game where 4 Stickmans defeat monsters and advance the stage!
        Let's make your own party by customizing class, status and items!
        You can play against world players in VS mode."
        Well, If that doesn't explain it enough for you, then I'll tell you this.
        In SMNW, the goal is to defeat the bosses of each stage, and advance across
        the map. <br />
        on the way, you will collect new items, you can use or sell them, and
        use these to your advantage.<br />
        what happens when you are done? Well, You'll have to figure that out
        yourself, huh?
