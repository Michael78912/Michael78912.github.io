    Hi there! I like the fact that you are looking at this website's code.
    Why though? Do you hate me so much that you are looking for a security leak?
    anyway, please don't judge it too much, I am bad at html.

        So, Yeah. My biggest project is Stickman's New World, a game
        based on
        <a href="https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/ranger">Stick Ranger</a>.
        You can find its page right here!
