         Welcome to the Stickman's New World homepage!

   <p>
      Stickman's new world is a game, which is mainly inspired by <a href="https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/ranger" target="_blank">Stick Ranger</a>.
      <br/>
      Stickman's New World is still in development, and I am guessing that the game, along with the first level will be released sometime
      in September-November this year.<br/>
      Stickman's New World is written in <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>, using the Excellent (notice the capital E :)) PyGame framework. <br/>
      Since it is definitely not ready for playing yet, as I haven't even gotten to any gameplay functionality yet, I would definitely adivse
      you to play <a href="https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/ranger" target="_blank">Stick Ranger</a> in your waiting time :).<br/>
      Stickman's New World is being created to be very easy to mod, and to require very little programming knowledge in order to add new levels, enemies, and weapons, however, (obviously) creating new classes, kind of weapons, status ailments, and other, more complicated things.
